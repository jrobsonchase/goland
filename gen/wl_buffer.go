// A buffer provides the content for a wl_surface. Buffers are
// created through factory interfaces such as wl_drm, wl_shm or
// similar. It has a width and a height and can be attached to a
// wl_surface, but the mechanism by which a client provides and
// updates the contents is defined by the buffer factory interface.
type WlBuffer interface {
	// Sent when this wl_buffer is no longer used by the compositor.
	// The client is now free to re-use or destroy this buffer and its
	// backing storage.
	// If a client receives a release event before the frame callback
	// requested in the same wl_surface.commit that attaches this
	// wl_buffer to a surface, then the client is immediately free to
	// re-use the buffer and its backing storage, and does not need a
	// second buffer for the next surface content update. Typically
	// this is possible, when the compositor maintains a copy of the
	// wl_surface contents, e.g. as a GL texture. This is an important
	// optimization for GL(ES) compositors with wl_shm clients.
	Release()
	// Destroy a buffer. If and how you need to release the backing
	// storage is defined by the buffer factory interface.
	// For possible side-effects to a surface, see wl_surface.attach.
	Destroy()
